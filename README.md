TO DO LIST APP

This app is an app to help users keep track of their daily/monthly/yearly tasks. 

A user can create multiple to-do lists and put tasks in them. There are options of deleting, editing, and adding a task to a list once it's created. When a user creates a task in a list, they input other data surrounding the task. They will input the name of the task, the category the task falls in under, the priority level of the task, and the time "deadline" for the task, and this will all be saved in the list for them to see.

This app relies on user input. Once you open it, a user will get several options--To open a new list, open a previous list, delete a task, delete a list, add a task to an existing list, or to quit the program.
